# Summary

I am a data scientist/machine learning engineer with experience in end to end model development and deployment.
I primarily work in Python but have released and maintained projects developed in C#, C++, and Java.
Problems solved include processing large amounts of data on cloud infrastrusture, deploying models on orchestration services, and optimizing data collection.
I have experience working on a diverse set of data modeling problems including deep learning on remote sensing data, Bayesian models on air quality sensor data, and optimal sequential decision making.
